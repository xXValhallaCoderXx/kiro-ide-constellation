      VS Code extension with MCP server integration
      Preact-based webview UI with Vite build system
      Graph Focus Mode is major new feature with comprehensive documentation
      UI component architecture documented for developer onboarding

- recent_findings:
  - gaps: [
      "Graph Focus Mode was fully implemented but completely undocumented",
      "UI component architecture needed developer guidelines", 
      "Interactive navigation patterns were not explained to users",
      "Performance characteristics and optimizations were not documented",
      "Integration between focus mode and impact analysis was unclear"
    ]
  - followups: [
      "Monitor user adoption of focus mode after documentation",
      "Consider adding architectural diagrams for complex interactions",
      "Evaluate need for video demonstrations of interactive features",
      "Track performance documentation accuracy against real usage"
    ]
