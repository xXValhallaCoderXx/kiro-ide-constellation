# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a new MCP tool called `constellation_analysis` within the Kiro IDE Constellation extension. The tool will serve as the foundation for file and path analysis capabilities, starting with a simple echo implementation that accepts user input and returns it back in the response.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using MCP tools, I want to invoke a `constellation_analysis` tool so that I can analyze files or paths in my workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `constellation_analysis` tool is invoked THEN the system SHALL register the tool with the MCP server
2. WHEN the tool is called with user input THEN the system SHALL accept the input parameter
3. WHEN the tool processes the input THEN the system SHALL return the input back in the response
4. WHEN the tool is invoked THEN the system SHALL follow the same pattern as the existing `constellation_ping` tool

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to accept file or path inputs so that I can specify what needs to be analyzed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is registered THEN the system SHALL define an input parameter for file or path
2. WHEN the input parameter is provided THEN the system SHALL validate it as a string
3. WHEN no input is provided THEN the system SHALL handle the case gracefully with appropriate error messaging
4. WHEN the input is processed THEN the system SHALL return it in a structured response format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to be properly documented so that I understand how to use it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is registered THEN the system SHALL provide a clear title and description
2. WHEN the tool schema is defined THEN the system SHALL include proper parameter documentation
3. WHEN the tool is listed THEN the system SHALL be discoverable alongside other MCP tools
4. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect the new tool in relevant documentation files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool implementation to be maintainable so that it can be extended in future iterations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is implemented THEN the system SHALL follow the existing code patterns in the MCP server
2. WHEN the tool is added THEN the system SHALL not break existing functionality
3. WHEN the tool is structured THEN the system SHALL allow for easy extension in future iterations
4. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN the system SHALL be ready for building and bundling with the existing MCP server
