# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds automated dependency analysis to the Kiro Constellation VS Code extension using Dependency Cruiser. The system will scan the user's workspace in the background to analyze code dependencies and generate a comprehensive dependency graph that can be used for codebase understanding and visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro Constellation, I want the extension to automatically analyze my workspace dependencies when it activates, so that I have up-to-date dependency information available without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension activates THEN the system SHALL trigger a background dependency scan of the current workspace
2. WHEN multiple workspace folders exist THEN the system SHALL scan the first workspace folder only
3. WHEN no workspace is open THEN the system SHALL perform no operation and continue normally
4. WHEN the scan is running THEN the system SHALL NOT block the extension activation or UI responsiveness
5. WHEN the scan completes THEN the system SHALL write results to `./.constellation/data/codebase-dependencies.json`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with JavaScript/TypeScript projects, I want the dependency analysis to focus on relevant code files and exclude build artifacts, so that the analysis is clean and meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning a workspace THEN the system SHALL exclude `node_modules`, `dist`, `out`, `build`, `coverage`, `.git`, `.vscode`, and `.constellation` directories
2. WHEN a `tsconfig.json` file exists in the workspace root THEN the system SHALL use it for TypeScript configuration
3. WHEN the workspace contains non-JS/TS files THEN the system SHALL ignore them per dependency-cruiser defaults
4. WHEN the scan encounters large repositories THEN the system SHALL timeout after 60 seconds to prevent hanging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer who needs reliable dependency information, I want the scan results to be properly formatted and versioned, so that I can trust the data structure and handle future changes gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing scan results THEN the system SHALL wrap the raw dependency-cruiser output in a versioned envelope
2. WHEN creating the output file THEN the system SHALL include metadata: version number, generation timestamp, and workspace root path
3. WHEN writing to the filesystem THEN the system SHALL ensure the `.constellation/data` directory exists
4. WHEN formatting the output THEN the system SHALL write pretty-printed JSON for readability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want dependency scanning to be robust and non-disruptive, so that scan failures don't impact my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency-cruiser is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log a warning and continue without user-facing errors
2. WHEN the scan process fails THEN the system SHALL catch errors and not disrupt extension functionality
3. WHEN the scan times out THEN the system SHALL kill the process gracefully and log the timeout
4. WHEN file I/O operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer who wants control over when scans occur, I want the ability to manually trigger dependency scans, so that I can refresh the analysis when my codebase changes significantly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I invoke the scan command THEN the system SHALL run a new dependency analysis
2. WHEN a manual scan is triggered THEN the system SHALL overwrite the existing results file
3. WHEN the command is executed THEN the system SHALL provide the same error handling as automatic scans
