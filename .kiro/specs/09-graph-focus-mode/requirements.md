# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Graph Focus Mode feature adds drill-down viewing capabilities to the existing graph webview in Kiro Constellation. This feature enables users to focus on specific nodes and their relationships, providing a more manageable way to explore large dependency graphs. Users can double-click any node to focus on that node and its children, navigate through breadcrumbs, and maintain stable layouts without full re-rendering.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer exploring a large codebase, I want to double-click on any node in the dependency graph to focus on that node and its immediate children, so that I can reduce visual complexity and concentrate on specific parts of the dependency tree.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user double-clicks on any node THEN the system SHALL focus on that node and display only its direct children (depth 1)
2. WHEN the focus view is applied THEN the system SHALL center the focused node in the viewport
3. WHEN focusing on a node THEN the system SHALL maintain the current layout positions without triggering a full re-layout
4. WHEN a node has no children THEN the system SHALL display an empty state message "No children at depth 1" while keeping the Reset option visible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer navigating through focused views, I want to see a breadcrumb navigation bar that shows my current path and allows me to jump back to previous views, so that I can easily understand my navigation context and return to earlier states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a focus view is active THEN the system SHALL display a breadcrumb bar above the graph canvas
2. WHEN the breadcrumb bar is displayed THEN it SHALL show the navigation path using file basenames separated by chevrons (â–¶)
3. WHEN a user clicks on any breadcrumb item THEN the system SHALL jump to that view state and truncate later breadcrumbs
4. WHEN the breadcrumb bar is displayed THEN it SHALL include a Reset button that returns to the full graph view
5. WHEN breadcrumb labels are too long THEN the system SHALL truncate them in the middle with ellipsis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer in a focused view, I want to press the Escape key to go back one level in my navigation history, so that I can quickly return to the previous view without using the mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses the Escape key AND breadcrumbs exist THEN the system SHALL navigate back to the previous breadcrumb level
2. WHEN a user presses the Escape key AND no breadcrumbs exist THEN the system SHALL take no action
3. WHEN navigating back via Escape THEN the system SHALL update the breadcrumb bar to reflect the new state
4. WHEN navigating back via Escape THEN the system SHALL center the new root node in the viewport

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the focus mode, I want to drill deeper into the dependency tree by double-clicking on child nodes, so that I can explore nested relationships and understand complex dependency chains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user double-clicks on a child node in a focused view THEN the system SHALL make that child the new root node
2. WHEN drilling deeper THEN the system SHALL add the previous root to the breadcrumb history
3. WHEN drilling deeper THEN the system SHALL display the new root and its direct children only
4. WHEN drilling deeper THEN the system SHALL center the new root node in the viewport
5. WHEN a user attempts to drill on a node with more than 100 children THEN the system SHALL cap the display at 100 children and show a "+N more" badge

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with impact analysis, I want the focus mode to integrate seamlessly with impact analysis results, so that I can drill down within the impact subgraph while maintaining impact-specific styling and context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN impact analysis results are displayed THEN the system SHALL automatically enter focus mode with the source file as the root
2. WHEN in impact analysis focus mode THEN the system SHALL seed the breadcrumbs with the source file as the first crumb
3. WHEN drilling within impact analysis THEN the system SHALL operate only on the filtered impact subgraph
4. WHEN the Reset button is clicked during impact analysis THEN the system SHALL clear both impact state and focus crumbs and restore the full graph
5. WHEN in impact analysis focus mode THEN the system SHALL maintain existing impact-specific styling (isSource, fromSource markers)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer using focus mode on large graphs, I want the system to perform efficiently with smooth interactions and quick visual updates, so that my exploration workflow is not interrupted by performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN computing visible nodes and edges THEN the system SHALL complete the operation in under 10ms for medium repositories
2. WHEN applying view changes THEN the system SHALL update styles within a single Cytoscape batch operation
3. WHEN focus operations take longer than 50ms THEN the system SHALL log timing information to the console for debugging
4. WHEN working with graphs over 1000 nodes THEN the system SHALL complete compute and apply operations in under 100ms
5. WHEN a node has extreme fan-out (>100 children) THEN the system SHALL cap the display and provide performance protection

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer using focus mode, I want clear visual indicators that help me understand the current focus state and node relationships, so that I can easily identify the root node, its children, and navigate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node is the current root THEN the system SHALL display it with a halo ring and thicker border
2. WHEN nodes are direct children of the root THEN the system SHALL display them with slightly thicker borders
3. WHEN nodes are not visible in the current focus THEN the system SHALL hide them using display:none styling by default
4. WHEN focus mode is active THEN the system SHALL optionally display a small chip showing depth and node/edge counts
5. WHEN transitioning between focus states THEN the system SHALL animate the centering with a 150-200ms duration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer encountering edge cases in focus mode, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can understand what happened and continue my work without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a root node is not found due to stale breadcrumbs THEN the system SHALL show a toast message and reset to the full graph
2. WHEN attempting to focus on a node with zero children THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
3. WHEN cycles exist in the dependency graph THEN the system SHALL handle them using a visited set during BFS traversal
4. WHEN the system encounters any focus mode error THEN it SHALL provide user-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions
5. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log detailed timing information for debugging purposes
