- notes: |
    First run - established baseline steering docs with domain separation.
    
    Key findings:
    - Clean domain separation achieved between server/ui/extension
    - All file counts well under limits (server: 18/25, ui: 17/20, extension: 7/15)
    - Minimal acceptable overlap (extension.ts in both server+extension domains)
    - Existing domain docs (messaging, onboarding, impact-analysis, etc.) preserved
    - No security violations or overbroad patterns detected
    
    Domain characteristics:
    - server: MCP implementation + service layer (18 files, largest domain)
    - ui: Preact components + webview services (17 files, component-heavy)
    - extension: VS Code integration points (7 files, focused scope)
    
    Next run should monitor:
    - Service layer growth (currently 14 services, approaching complexity)
    - UI component proliferation (8 components, room for growth)
    - New domain emergence (testing, docs, deployment patterns)
