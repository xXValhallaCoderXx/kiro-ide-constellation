      VS Code extension with MCP server integration
      Preact-based webview UI with Vite build system
      Graph Focus Mode is major new feature requiring comprehensive documentation
      UI component architecture needs documentation for developer onboarding

- recent_findings:
  - gaps: [
      "Graph Focus Mode completely undocumented despite full implementation",
      "UI component architecture missing developer guidelines", 
      "Interactive navigation patterns not explained to users",
      "Performance characteristics and optimizations not documented",
      "Integration between focus mode and impact analysis unclear"
    ]
  - followups: [
      "Monitor user adoption of focus mode after documentation",
      "Consider adding architectural diagrams for complex interactions",
      "Evaluate need for video demonstrations of interactive features",
      "Track performance documentation accuracy against real usage"
    ]
